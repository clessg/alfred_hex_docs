# HexDocs Alfred Workflow

Quickly open Hex Package Documentation from Alfred, with autocomplete
suggestions.

## Overview

This is a workflow that lets you search for a Hex (Elixir) package and open the
docs. It aims to supplement the excellent [Package Managers](https://github.com/willfarrell/alfred-pkgman-workflow) Alfred Workflow by
@willfarrell. Which is why it launches with `hexdocs` as the trigger instead of
just `hex`.

## Dependencies

- Alfred Power Pack
- Elixir (& Erlang) installed via [ASDF](https://asdf-vm.com/)
- https://asdf-vm.com/guide/getting-started.html
- `asdf install erlang latest`
- `asdf install elixir latest`

## Installation

1. Download the workflow from Github Releases: https://github.com/dkarter/alfred_hex_docs/releases/latest/download/hexdocs.alfredworkflow
2. Open the file to install the workflow

## Usage

Open Alfred and type `hexdocs [package name]`. Press Enter to open the docs or
Shift for a quick preview.
