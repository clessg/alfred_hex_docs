# HexDocs Alfred Workflow

Quickly open Hex Package Documentation from Alfred, with autocomplete
suggestions.

## Overview
This is a workflow that lets you search for a Hex (Elixir) package and open the
docs. It aims to supplement the excellent [Package Managers](https://github.com/willfarrell/alfred-pkgman-workflow) Alfred Workflow by
@willfarrell. Which is why it launches with `hexdocs` as the trigger instead of
just `hex`.

## Dependencies

- Alfred Power Pack
- Ruby (`asdf install ruby latest`)

## Usage

Open Alfred and type `hexdocs [package name]`. Press Enter to open the docs or
Shift for a quick preview.
